# Middleware Contracts

## Overview
Middleware Contracts are responsible for ensuring the smooth integration of the VetShare ZKP DApp with the Midnight Network. They handle communication between the core smart contracts and the network infrastructure, including transaction processing, error handling, and data flow management.

## Features
- **Transaction Management**: Ensures smooth and secure transactions between smart contracts and the Midnight Network.
- **Network Compatibility**: Manages any necessary adaptations for seamless interaction with the Midnight Networkâ€™s privacy framework.
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error management for middleware operations, ensuring resilience in case of unexpected failures.

## Planned Enhancements
- **Optimized Data Handling**: Improve data flow between the VetShare DApp and the network to handle increased loads and more complex data sets.
- **Scalability**: Enhance middleware to support larger data volumes and higher transaction throughput for future expansion.
