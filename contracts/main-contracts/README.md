# Main Contracts

## Overview
The Main Contracts are responsible for the core logic of the VetShare ZKP DApp. These contracts handle the selective data disclosure using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to ensure that veterinary data is shared securely and privately.

## Features
- **Data Encryption**: Securely encrypt veterinary data for sharing.
- **Selective Disclosure**: Allows selective sharing of data based on predefined rules.
- **ZKP Integration**: Ensures privacy by proving knowledge without revealing underlying data.

## Planned Enhancements
- **Versioning**: Implement contract upgrades and version management.
- **Advanced Disclosure**: Allow more granular control over disclosed data.

Contributions and feedback are welcome! Please use issues and pull requests for discussions.
